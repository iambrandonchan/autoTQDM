To do list:
	-consider if there is a list comprehension case
	-consider if there is an iter(), iter.next() case

	-add functionality to make a copy of a file to run(don't want to add permanent changes)
	-add functionality to maybe tqdm a file, run it, display results? then delete the file
	-add functionality to only tqdm 1 level of for loops, not nested

	-add unit testing?
